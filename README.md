# Morlex
A scientific exploratory vehicle has been sent on an interstellar journey to observe and investigate an extraterrestrial life form. The complex phenomena that occur upon the surface of the planet seems to suggest a kind of rational activity. But the first trial of a new type of C-Beam experimentation gives unexpected results, the planet starts a human-like conversation.
